How long did you spend working on this project?
I worked around 4 hours on and off to complete the project

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge I conquered was when I made the add_to_products in the product class.
This took me a while to figure this out, but once this was achieved all others pretty much fell into place

What two additional features did you build? Why?
a) Feature 1 - Added additional error handling for find_by_name method for Product and Customer class & find(id) method for 4
                    Transaction class when there is no match from the search. This provides the user with proper feedback if a
                    non existent item is being searched for.

b) Feature 2 - Added two new class methods for Transaction class
                  find_by_cust method - returns all products purchased by a particular customer
                  find_by_prod method - returns all customers who purchased a particular product

                  These 2 methods provide further detailed reporting to help manager in the decision making process.

Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I have a lot of room to grow in understanding and implementing
 object oriented design.
